# YARA_Rules
YARA Rules (Unverified)

This repository contains YARA rules which can be used (at your own risk) to hunt for malware. These yara rules are often created automatically (using YarGen - available at https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen)
Use these rules at your own risk. I don't have time to review/revise/edit them so please don't ask. However, if you have any feedback feel free to send along or if you'd like me to post a rule that you have created, please don't hesitate to reach out.

AGAIN, EVERTHING IN HERE IS USE-AT-YOUR-OWN-RISK.
